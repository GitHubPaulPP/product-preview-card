## My process

    Looking through the designs to start planning the project.
    Structuring content with HTML.
    Writing out the styles for the project and adding styles from the top on down.
    Debugging.
    Deploying the completed project.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

1. To prevent the image from being squished when the window is narrow, use CSS's object-fit property, which controls how the content of a replaced element, like an img, should be resized. Setting object-fit: cover; on the image will ensure it covers the area of the box without being distorted.
2. To change the cursor to a hand (pointer) when the user hovers over the button or clicks it, add the cursor property to the .button1 class (cursor: pointer;).
3. Have to read up on transitions and transforms.
